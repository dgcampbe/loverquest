## What is Loverquest
Loverquest is a digital board game with an intimate theme, designed to help couples explore their sexuality in a fun and engaging way.

Each game starts by choosing a deck of cards, called a deck, which contains different types of challenges, called quests. These can be completed alone or with your partner, with the goal of discovering new experiences and making couple life more intriguing and stimulating.

## Why play Loverquest?
Loverquest allows you to experiment with new experiences and rekindle couple intimacy in a fun, customizable, and discreet way.

One of its strengths is great customization: you can choose from preset decks or create your own personalized decks, tailoring them to your tastes and desires. This way, every game becomes a unique and tailor-made experience for you and your partner.

Additionally, Loverquest respects your privacy: it does not collect personal data, does not access the Internet, and does not display ads. For us, intimacy is a serious matter, and we are committed to guaranteeing you maximum confidentiality.

## Game Modes
There are two game modes:
- **In-person play:** Partners play together physically. After each completed action, the turn passes to the other player.
- **Remote play:** Partners play separately, using their favorite chat or video call app. Each player scrolls through their own quests independently, alternating with their partner. (Loverquest accepts no responsibility for any illegal acts committed online, such as the non-consensual distribution of intimate material, sharing of child pornography content, or other law violations.)

## Couple Types
At Loverquest, we believe that love belongs to everyone. To ensure an inclusive and conscious experience, couples are classified only based on genitals, allowing the selection of the most suitable deck for their needs. Available categories are:
- **Heterosexual couple:** Partners have different genitals.
- **Lesbian couple:** Both partners have female genitals.
- **Gay couple:** Both partners have male genitals.
